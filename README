This package (and the resulting tarball) contains a GNU Radio block
for the Funcube Dongle. The Funcube Dongle is a software defined radio
receiver in a USB stick covering 64 MHz - 1.7 GHz. More info about the
Funcube Dongle is avaialble at http://www.funcubedongle.com/

The Funcube Dongle provides I/Q data via USB audio and its control
interface (frequency, gains, filters) uses the USB HID api. This block
wraps both the audio input and the control interface into one convenient
GNU Radio source block with a complex data stream output that can be used
in GNU Radio application written in C++, Python and the GNU Radio Companion.

This package requires that gnuradio-core and gnuradio-audio 3.5 is already
installed. It also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost.
On Linux you will also need libusb-1.0 for the HID control interface.

To build the gnuradio-fcd library and the included examples use the normal
recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

If you're building from git, you'll need to use this sequence, since
git doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

The configure script has many options for fine tuning the build and the
installation. Use the --help option to get a list.

This package includes the hidapi: http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/
and the FCD API code from Qthid: http://qthid.sf.net/ 

This package was created by Alexandru Csete OZ9AEC, and it is based on the
gr-howto-write-a-block example package by Eric Blossom and contributors.
