Alexandru Csete (22):
      Bump version number.
      Small typo fix.
      Implemented FCD_CMD_APP_SET_FREQ_HZ in FCD API and switched to use that one in gr-fcd API.
      In python ww only need set_freq with float parameter.
      Fix DC and IQ correction methods.
      Add frequency and LNA gain controls to FFT application.
      Remove debug output.
      Correct order of parameters for IQ balance.
      Fix parameter names in doxygen doc.
      No need for iostream.
      NOAA APT receiver example (not tested).
      Include NFM GRC example in distribution.
      Merge branch 'master' of github.com:csete/gr-fcd
      Default value for DC offset is 0.0
      Set RF gain from slider value.
      Fix noinst_HEADERS.
      Merge pull request #1 from jrcutler/master
      Require GNU Radio 3.5
      Merge pull request #3 from jrcutler/master
      Check for GR version 3.5 or later.
      Rename hidwin.cpp to hidwin.c to stay consistent with upstream codebase.
      Update to hidapi 0.7.0

Justin R. Cutler (3):
      Moved initial set_freq() call after initializing settings.
      Adding throttle tag to GRC block to prevent grc warnings.
      Implemented an implicit re-tune upon modification of the frequency correction value (via a shadow variable for last requested frequency). Fixes #2.

Michael Zappe (1):
      Improved build on OSX and Windows.
